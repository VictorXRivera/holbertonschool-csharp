# 0x07. C# - Test Driven Development
# Specializations - AR/VR ― C#
# by Carrie Ybay, Software Engineer at Holberton School

## Learning Objectives
* What are solutions in VSCode
* How are solutions different from projects in VSCode
* What is a class library
* What is a unit test
* What are the benefits of unit testing
* How to create and run tests using NUnit
* What is the Arrange, Act, Assert methodology
* How to effectively name your unit tests
* How to utilize the TDD approach
* How to consider edge cases

## Requirements
<b>C# Tasks</b>
* Allowed editors: Visual Studio Code
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using dotnet
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* All default C# files named Program.cs should be renamed to the name given in each task
* Each C# task requires its own folder and .sln file. Push all task folders to your Github and ensure the task names on the folders are correct
* You do not need to push your obj/ or bin/ folders
* In the following examples, the main.cs files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.cs files at compilation. Our main.cs files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* All your public classes and their members should have XML documentation tags
* All your private classes and members should be documented but without XML documentation tags

<b>C# Tests</b>
* Allowed editors: Visual Studio Code
* All tests should be inside a separate folder and named as specified in each task
* All your test files will be executed using dotnet test
* We strongly encourage you to work together on tests so that you don’t miss any edge cases

## More Information
In past C# assignments, you have been creating individual console application projects for each task. In this assignment, you are going to create a solution file to allow you to manage multiple projects. Each task is one solution containing two projects: one class library solving the task and one test library to test the class library.

For each task in this project:

Create task directory (ex: 0-add)
Inside that directory, run dotnet new sln
Create a new directory for your task solution based on the namespace given (ex: MyMath). This directory will hold your new standard class library.
Inside that directory, run dotnet new classlib. Rename the resulting .cs file after the namespace (ex: MyMath.cs)
Enable XML documentation by adding <DocumentationFile>bin\$(Configuration)\$(TargetFramework)\$(AssemblyName).xml</DocumentationFile> to MyMath.csproj
The target framework for this standard class library should be netstandard2.0
Change directory back to the root directory of the task (ex: 0-add) and run dotnet sln add <classlibrary/classlibrary.csproj> (ex. dotnet sln add MyMath/MyMath.csproj)
Create a new directory for your tests based on the namespace given plus .Tests (ex: MyMath.Tests). This directory will hold your test library.
Inside that directory, run dotnet new nunit. Rename the resulting .cs file after the namespace of classes you are testing plus .Tests (ex: MyMath.Tests.cs)
To add your class library as a dependency to the project, run dotnet add reference <../classlibrary/classlibrary.csproj> (ex: dotnet add reference ../MyMath/MyMath.csproj)
In the task’s root directory, run dotnet sln add <testlibrary/testlibrary.csproj (ex: dotnet sln add MyMath.Tests/MyMath.Tests.csproj)
If you’d like to run your class library method in a console application, create a new directory and run dotnet new console inside it. Run dotnet add reference <../classlibrary/classlibrary.csproj> and you can then call your class library methods inside the console application.
For more detail, read the Unit Testing C# with NUnit and .NET Core tutorial.

The resulting directory hierarchy for task #0 will look like this:
```C#
/0-add
    0-add.sln
    /MyMath
        MyMath.cs
        MyMath.csproj
    /MyMath.Tests
        MyMath.Tests.cs
        MyMath.Tests.csproj
```
## For this project:
* Based on the requirements of each task, you should write the documentation and tests first before you actually code anything
* The intranet checks for C# projects won’t be released before their first deadline in order for you to focus more on TDD and thinking about all possible cases
* We strongly encourage you to work together on tests so that you don’t miss any edge cases
* Don’t trust the user, always think about all possible edge cases
* Note: The videos provided as resources use Visual Studio, not Visual Studio Code. While the two programs differ, the methods and concepts behind unit testing are the same.

If NUnit is not already installed, use the command: dotnet new -i NUnit3.DotNetNew.Template

## Tasks
<b>0. Add integers</b>
Write a method that adds 2 numbers
* Namespace: MyMath
* Class: Operations
* Prototype: public static int Add(int a, int b)
* Returns: sum of a and b
* Test Library Namespace: MyMath.Tests
* It is not necessary to account for integer overflow in this task

<b>1. Divide a matrix</b>
Write a method that divides all elements of a matrix.
* Namespace: MyMath
* Class: Matrix
* Prototype: public static int[,] Divide(int[,] matrix, int num)
* Returns: a new matrix containing divided elements
* If num is 0, print Num cannot be 0 and return null. (Hint: use try / catch)
* If matrix is null, return null

<b>2. Max integer</b>
Write a method that returns the max integer in a list of integers.
* Namespace: MyMath
* Class: Operations
* Prototype: public static int Max(List<int> nums)
* Returns: max integer in list
* If nums is empty, return 0

<b>3. Desserts, I stressed!</b>
* Namespace: Text
* Class: Str
* Prototype: public static bool IsPalindrome(string s)
* Returns: True if string is a palindrome, False if it’s not

In this task, palindromes are not case sensitive

```
Racecar = True
level = True
Spaces and punctuation should be ignored
```
```
A man, a plan, a canal: Panama. = True
```
An empty string is considered a palindrome

<b>4. Unique character</b>
Write a method that returns the index of the first non-repeating character of a string.
* Namespace: Text
* Class: Str
* Prototype: public static int UniqueChar(string s)
* Returns: index of first non-repeating character or -1 if there is no non-repeating character
* You can assume the string contains only lowercase letters, no spaces or special characters

<b>5. camelCase</b>
Write a method that determines how many words are in a string. Each word begins with a capital letter except the first word.
* Namespace: Text
* Class: Str
* Prototype: public static int CamelCase(string s)
* Returns: number of words in s
